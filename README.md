# [Project 1:Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/sashadata/project_correlation-.git)

This is an example of an exploratory data analysis. The dataset represents data collected from a social welfare project. The code performs the following functions: (1) explore the structure of the dataset, (2) describe existing variables, (3) identify missing values, (4) run frequency tables and crosstabs, (5) explore the relationship between gender and program drop outs, (6) identify age groups at increased risk of dropping out, and (6) create a correlation chart.

# [Project 2: Monitoring Dashboard for Agency](https://github.com/sashadata/project_monitoring-dashboard.git)

It is common practice to use a dashboard to track project progress. The code shows an easy way to create such a dashboard. It can be completed using RStudio with the markdown and shiny packages installed. These resources are publicly available free of charge. The main purpose of this dashboard is to obtain insights about the project standing. By following the link below, you can access a live dashboard that shows progress by outcomes achieved and connects outcomes with beneficiary demographics; shows popular services delivered; and shows the frequency of activities by month. Go to [Monitoring Dashboard for Agency](https://aleksandr-pugachev.shinyapps.io/Dashboard/?_ga=2.76574870.247857756.1654793361-1854485590.1654793361)

# [Project 3: Monitoring Reports Using R Markdown](https://github.com/sashadata/monitoring-reports-using-r-markdown.git)  


This code creates a program monitoring report using RStudio with the markdown package installed. If an agency uses a database (or multiple databases) to track beneficiary data, the code demonstrated can pull raw data and create custom reports. RStudio with the markdown package installed allows for there to be interactive elements within the reports. The report produced by the demonstrated code includes various charts illustrating the current standing of the program and also does more sophisticated analyses such as hypothesis testing and logistic regression.

# [Project 4: Client Profiles](https://github.com/sashadata/clients-profiles.git) 

Knowing your program clients well strongly correlates with successful program implementation. This code identifies different segments among clients served based on age, household size, income, days in program, number of services received, goals pursued, etc. This is done using a k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm, which is widely applied in machine learning.

# [Project 5: Logistic regression](https://github.com/sashadata/logistic-regression.git)

The caseworkers provided more than 3,000 services and opened 600 cases. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected for the target group. Last year, 33% of enrolled clients failed to achieve the set outcomes. The code identifies clients likely to fail to achieve set outcomes and flags them for additional support.

# [Project 6: Regression Analysis]

The agency provides various public services to low-income families. The family opens cases and starts receiving services. Agency advocates, depending on the needs of family members,  assist the family to overcome the current crisis. Every family can work on several cases with advocates from different departments (public health, early childhood education, family well-being, housing etc). For better project planning with respect of staff busyness, this analysis looks at predicting the number of cases to be opened from other demographics variables of beneficiaries.  Personal data recorded includes age, income, assessment score, number of services, days spent in program, number of children in the family. (Work is in progress)
