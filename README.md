# [Project 1:Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/sashadata/project_correlation-.git)

This is example of exploratory data analysis. The dataset presents data collected from social project. The code shows general approach to look at the data (1) explore structure, (2) describe exiciting variables, (3) identify missing data, (4) run frequency tables and crosstabs, (5) explore relationship between gender and drops, (6) indentify new age categorities groups, which are at risk of dropping, and (6) create correlation chart.

# [Project 2: Monitoring Dashboard for Agency](https://github.com/sashadata/project_monitoring-dashboard.git)

It is common practice to use dashboard to track the progress project The project shows easy way to create monitoring dashboard for an agency. It can be completed using RStudio, markdown and shiny packages. These resources are free and accessible for general public. The main purpose of this dashboard is to obtain insights about the program standing. By following the link below you can view the dashboard that shows progress by outcomes achieved, connects outcome with demographics of beneficiaries, popular services delivered, and frequency of activities by month. Go to [Agency Monitoring Dashboard](https://aleksandr-pugachev.shinyapps.io/Dashboard/?_ga=2.76574870.247857756.1654793361-1854485590.1654793361)

# [Project 3: Monitoring Reports Using R Markdown](https://github.com/sashadata/monitoring-reports-using-r-markdown.git)  


This project focuses on creating moniroting program report using R markdown. If agency uses databases to track data about beneficiaries, there is a possibility to pull raw data and create reports based on your team needs. The cool thing about R markdown is that it allows adding intercative to analysis. This report shows various charts on the current standing of project (ex. number enrolled by outcome, total number of services, popular services, the flow of service delivery), test hypothesis if gender associated with achieving successful completition), and peform logistic regressoin with indentifying important varimables impacting the program successful completition.

# [Project 4: Clients Profiles](https://github.com/sashadata/clients-profiles.git) 

This project looks at identifing different segments in the existing clients based on their income, age, household size as well as days in program, number of services received, goals attempted etc.

# [Project 5: Logistic regression](https://github.com/sashadata/logistic-regression.git)

The caseworkers provided more than 3000 services and opened 600 cases. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected for the target group. The last year result show that 33% of enrolled clinets failed to acheive the result. The key intention is to find out clients that are likely to fail and provide additional support for them to successfully complete the program. The project has two key goals (1) To identify the different factors that impact the failure to achieve the outcome
and (2) To make a model to predict if your client will acheive the outcome or not.

# [Project 6: Regression Analysis]

The agency provides various public services to low-income families. The family opens cases and starts receiving services. Agency advocates, depending on the needs of family members,  assist the family to overcome the current crisis. Every family can work on several cases with advocates from different departments (public health, early childhood education, family well-being, housing etc). For better project planning with respect of staff busyness, this analysis looks at predicting the number of cases to be opened from other demographics variables of beneficiaries.  Personal data recorded includes age, income, assessment score, number of services, days spent in program, number of children in the family. (Work is in progress)
